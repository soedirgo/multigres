// The scrubber is the safety net for state the pool trusts without
// verification: the gateway-authoritative session model reuses connections
// with zero SQL (pointer-equal labels, clean-stack reuse), so any backend
// mutation that escaped tracking — a set_config hidden in a routine body, a
// tracking bug, an out-of-band DDL — silently leaks to the next borrower.
// The scrubber periodically runs every registered ConnChecker against idle
// connections, emits metrics when real backend state diverges from tracked
// state, and closes and replaces divergent connections.
//
// It only touches idle connections, so it adds no latency to the query path.
// It is a sampler: it narrows the leak window and raises an alarm, but the
// tracking gates remain the correctness boundary.
//
// Coverage: the scrubber works in passes. Each tick probes, from the next
// non-empty stack, the topmost idle connection not yet probed in the current
// pass, and marks it with the pass number; once every idle connection in
// every stack carries the current pass number, the next pass begins. Simply
// re-probing the top each tick would never reach the connections beneath
// it, since clients also take and return connections at the top.
//
// A probed connection goes back at the depth it was taken from, with its
// idle clock intact. Both matter for idle-timeout shrinking: pushing it on
// top (or to the bottom, which rotates the stack) promotes a cold connection
// into client traffic, real use refreshes its idle clock, and over a pass
// every connection gets refreshed in turn — the pool would sit at its
// maximum idle size instead of shrinking to its working set.

// scrubProbeTimeout bounds one checker's probe; each checker gets its own
// budget, so a slow early probe cannot starve later checkers into a timeout
// that the fail-closed error path would turn into needless churn. Pool close
// cancels pool.scrubCtx before draining, so in-flight probes never stall
// shutdown; this timeout only bounds probes against a hung backend.
